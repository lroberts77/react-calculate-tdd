## <a name="Project">Project Direction</a>
I created this app to improve my understanding of TDD and code testing using React. Although I ran into quite a few problems I learned alot during the course of making this app including shallow and mounted testing, component separation, snapshot testing and CI/CD with Travis CI and Github-pages.

## <a name="Install">Installation</a>
The deployed live app is [HERE](https://lroberts77.github.io/react-calculate-tdd/)

* Or to clone the repo
```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:lroberts77/react-calculate-tdd.git
$ cd react-calculator
$ npm install
```

## <a name="Npmtest">Npm Testing</a>

```

## <a name="Usage">Usage</a>
* In the root of the project
```shell
$ npm start
```
If a tab doesn't open with the calculator app running, open a new tab and type in localhost:3000 in the url bar and press enter. After the calculator has loaded click on the keys and use like a normal calculator.
