## <a name="Project">Project Direction</a>
I created this app to improve my understanding of TDD, code testing using React and experiment with CSS. Although I ran into quite a few problems I learned alot during the course of making this app including shallow and mounted testing, component separation, snapshot testing and CI/CD with Travis CI and Github-pages.

If a tab doesn't open with the calculator app running, open a new tab and type in http://localhost:5000 in the url bar and press enter. After the calculator has loaded click on the keys and use like a normal calculator.
